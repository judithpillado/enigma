# Self Assessment 

For **functionality** I would give myself a 2.5. I am not sure if I did the I/O part correctly because it was really hard for me to grasp that concept. I'm still unsure how why I have to use it and how I could implement that into future projects. However, I successfully implemented the methods for decryption and encryption on my Enigma class. Everything was running smoothly. 

For **OOP** I would also give myself a 2.5. I think that my encrypt and decrypt methods might have been a little too long, although I did set up some helper metods to break down the longer methods. 

For **Ruby Conventions and Mechanics** I would give myself a 3 because my methods were longer than 10 lines. Besides that, syntax is consistent and the code is organized. 

Finally, for **TDD** I would give myself a 3 because I did not use mocks and stubs. My git history shows that I was writing tests before code.
